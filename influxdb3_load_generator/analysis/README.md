# Load Generator Analysis

This directory contains a lightweight Flask app to compare two runs of the load generator. The app is designed to be run locally and is not intended for production use.

## Setup

```bash
pip install flask
```

## Running the app

To run the app, navigate to the `analysis` directory and run:

```bash
python app.py <path to results directory>
```

Then open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the app.
