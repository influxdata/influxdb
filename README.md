# InfluxDB [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/influxdata/influxdb/tree/master-1.x.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/influxdata/influxdb/tree/master-1.x) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/influxdata/influxdb)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/influxdata/influxdb) [![Docker pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/library/influxdb.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/)

# ATTENTION:

Around January 11th, 2019, `master` on this repository will become InfluxDB 2.0 code. The content of `infludata/platform` will be moved to this repository. If you rely on `master`, you should update your dependencies to track the `master-1.x` branch.

## An Open-Source Time Series Database

InfluxDB is an open source **time series database** with
**no external dependencies**. It's useful for recording metrics,
events, and performing analytics.

## Features

* Built-in [HTTP API](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/guides/writing_data/) so you don't have to write any server side code to get up and running.
* Data can be tagged, allowing very flexible querying.
* SQL-like query language.
* Simple to install and manage, and fast to get data in and out.
* It aims to answer queries in real-time. That means every data point is
  indexed as it comes in and is immediately available in queries that
  should return in < 100ms.

## Installation

We recommend installing InfluxDB using one of the [pre-built packages](https://influxdata.com/downloads/#influxdb). Then start InfluxDB using:

* `service influxdb start` if you have installed InfluxDB using an official Debian or RPM package.
* `systemctl start influxdb` if you have installed InfluxDB using an official Debian or RPM package, and are running a distro with `systemd`. For example, Ubuntu 15 or later.
* `$GOPATH/bin/influxd` if you have built InfluxDB from source.

## Getting Started

### Create your first database

```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8086/query" --data-urlencode "q=CREATE DATABASE mydb"
```

### Insert some data
```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8086/write?db=mydb" \
-d 'cpu,host=server01,region=uswest load=42 1434055562000000000'

curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8086/write?db=mydb" \
-d 'cpu,host=server02,region=uswest load=78 1434055562000000000'

curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8086/write?db=mydb" \
-d 'cpu,host=server03,region=useast load=15.4 1434055562000000000'
```

### Query for the data
```JSON
curl -G "http://localhost:8086/query?pretty=true" --data-urlencode "db=mydb" \
--data-urlencode "q=SELECT * FROM cpu WHERE host='server01' AND time < now() - 1d"
```

### Analyze the data
```JSON
curl -G "http://localhost:8086/query?pretty=true" --data-urlencode "db=mydb" \
--data-urlencode "q=SELECT mean(load) FROM cpu WHERE region='uswest'"
```
