## Installation
We have nightly and versioned Docker images, Debian packages, RPM packages, and tarballs of InfluxDB available on the [InfluxData downloads page](https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/). We also provide the InfluxDB command line interface (CLI) client as a separate binary available at the same location.

- For v1 installation, use the [main 1.x branch](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/tree/master-1.x) or [install InfluxDB OSS directly](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1/introduction/install/#installing-influxdb-oss).
- For v2 installation, use the [main 2.x branch](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/tree/main-2.x).
- **v3 development is on this main branch. This project is actively under development and is not considered stable.**
