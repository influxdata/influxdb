Program:
    This application performs quick checks on the provided InfluxDB
    package. InfluxDB should *not* be installed on the system before
    running this application. This validates new installations and
    performs specific checks relevant only to InfluxDB.

Options:
    type    Must be "deb" or "rpm". This option instructs the
            application to use the package manager associated
            with "type".
    path    Path to InfluxDB package to validate.
