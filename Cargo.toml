# `version` uses a `-nightly` on `main` branch so that snapshot releases cut from main will display
# `-nightly` in the revision information of the running server. Releases cut from a release branch
# will not use `-nightly`.
#
# The version here leads the latest released minor version. So, if the latest release is `3.0.2`,
# then this will be `3.1.0-nightly`. Once `3.1.0` is released, this will be bumped to `3.2.0-nightly`,
# and will remain that regardless of how many `3.1.x` patch releases are done prior to the `3.2.0`
# release.

# Patching Arrow
#
# Assuming you have a local checkout of Arrow in a directory alongside your local checkout of influxdb3_core,
# and you have changes to Arrow in your local checkout that you want to test out with influxdb3_core,
# uncomment this `[patch.crates-io]` section to tell Cargo to use your local arrow versions for all
# transitive dependencies. The entries for the `arrow-*` crates are needed because `datafusion` has
# a direct dependency on them.
#
# WARNING: Do not merge in a PR uncommenting this change! This is for local testing only!
