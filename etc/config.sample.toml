### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report anonymous data to m.influxdb.com
# The data includes raft id (random 8 bytes), os, arch, version, and metadata.
# We don't track ip addresses of servers reporting. This is only used
# to track the number of instances running and the versions, which
# is very helpful for us.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = false

# we'll try to get the hostname automatically, but if it the os returns something
# that isn't resolvable by other servers in the cluster, use this option to
# manually set the hostname
# hostname = "localhost"

###
### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.
###

[meta]
  # Controls if this node should run the metaservice and participate in the Raft group

### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
###

[data]
  # Controls if this node holds time series data shards in the cluster
  enabled = true

  # wal-max-series-size = 2097152

  # Force a flush of all series and full compaction if there have been no writes in this

  # block in a TSM file. Larger numbers may yield better compression
  # but could incur a performance peanalty when querying
  # max-points-per-block = 1000

### [hinted-handoff]
###
### Controls the hinted handoff feature, which allows nodes to temporarily
### store queued data when one node of a cluster is down for a short period
### of time.
###

  # Hinted handoff will start retrying writes to down nodes at a rate of once per second.
  # If any error occurs, it will backoff in an exponential manner, until the interval
  # reaches retry-max-interval. Once writes to all nodes are successfully completed the
  # interval will reset to retry-interval.
  retry-interval = "1s"
  retry-max-interval = "1m"

  # Interval between running checks for data that should be purged. Data is purged from
  # hinted-handoff queues for two reasons. 1) The data is older than the max age, or
  # 2) the target node has been dropped from the cluster. Data is never dropped until
  # it has reached max-age however, for a dropped node or not.
  purge-interval = "1h"

###
### [cluster]
###
### Controls non-Raft cluster behavior, which generally includes how data is
### shared across shards.
###

[cluster]
  shard-writer-timeout = "5s" # The time within which a remote shard must respond to a write request.
  write-timeout = "10s" # The time within which a write request must complete on the cluster.

###
### [retention]
###
### Controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.
###

[retention]
  enabled = true

###
### [shard-precreation]
###
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are available before data arrives.
### Only shards that, after creation, will have both a start- and end-time in the
### future, will ever be created. Shards are never precreated that would be wholly
### or partially in the past.

[shard-precreation]
  enabled = true

  advance-period = "30m"

###
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
###
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.

[monitor]

  ### This string joins multiple matching 'measurement' values providing more control over the final measurement name.
  # separator = "."

  ### Default tags that will be added to all metrics.  These can be overridden at the template level
  ### or by tags extracted from metric
  # tags = ["region=us-east", "zone=1c"]

  ### Each template line requires a template pattern.  It can have an optional
  ### filter before the template and separated by spaces.  It can also have optional extra
  ### tags following the template.  Multiple tags should be separated by commas and no spaces
  ### similar to the line protocol format.  There can be only one default template.
