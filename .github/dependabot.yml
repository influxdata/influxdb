      # Thrift version needs to match the version of the thrift-compiler used to generate code,
      # and therefore this dependency requires a more manual upgrade
      #
      # Additionally the thrift-compiler version available in standard repos tends to lag
      # the latest release significantly, and so updating to the latest version adds friction
