//! Manage application shutdown
//!
//! This crate provides a set of types for managing graceful application shutdown.
//!
//! # Coordinate shutdown with the [`ShutdownManager`] type
//!
//! The [`ShutdownManager`] is used to coordinate shutdown of the process in an ordered fashion.
//! When a shutdown is signaled externally, e.g., `ctrl+c`, or internally by some error state, then
//! there may be processes running on the backend that need to be gracefully stopped before the
//! HTTP/gRPC frontend. For example, if the WAL has writes buffered, it needs to flush the buffer to
//! object store and respond to the write request before the HTTP/gRPC frontend is taken down.
//!
//! Components can [`register`][ShutdownManager::register] to receive a [`ShutdownToken`], which can
//! be used to [`wait_for_shutdown`][ShutdownToken::wait_for_shutdown] to trigger component-specific
//! cleanup logic before signaling back via [`complete`][ShutdownToken::complete] to indicate that
//! shutdown can proceed.
