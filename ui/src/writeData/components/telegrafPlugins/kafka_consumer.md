# Kafka Consumer Input Plugin

The [Kafka][kafka] consumer plugin reads from Kafka
and creates metrics using one of the supported [input data formats][].

For old kafka version (< 0.8), please use the [kafka_consumer_legacy][] input plugin
and use the old zookeeper connection method.

### Configuration

```toml
[[inputs.kafka_consumer]]
  ## Kafka brokers.
  brokers = ["localhost:9092"]

  ## Topics to consume.
  topics = ["telegraf"]

  ## When set this tag will be added to all metrics with the topic as the value.
  # topic_tag = ""

  ## Optional Client id
  # client_id = "Telegraf"

  ## Set the minimal supported Kafka version.  Setting this enables the use of new
  ## Kafka features and APIs.  Must be 0.10.2.0 or greater.
  ##   ex: version = "1.1.0"
  # version = ""

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false

  ## SASL authentication credentials.  These settings should typically be used
  ## with TLS encryption enabled using the "enable_tls" option.
  # sasl_username = "kafka"
  # sasl_password = "secret"

  ## SASL protocol version.  When connecting to Azure EventHub set to 0.
  # sasl_version = 1

  ## Name of the consumer group.
  # consumer_group = "telegraf_metrics_consumers"

  ## Initial offset position; one of "oldest" or "newest".
  # offset = "oldest"

  ## Consumer group partition assignment strategy; one of "range", "roundrobin" or "sticky".
  # balance_strategy = "range"

  ## Maximum length of a message to consume, in bytes (default 0/unlimited);
  ## larger messages are dropped
  max_message_len = 1000000

  ## Maximum messages to read from the broker that have not been written by an
  ## output.  For best throughput set based on the number of metrics within
  ## each message and the size of the output's metric_batch_size.
  ##
  ## For example, if each message from the queue contains 10 metrics and the
  ## output metric_batch_size is 1000, setting this to 100 will ensure that a
  ## full batch is collected and the write is triggered immediately without
  ## waiting until the next flush_interval.
  # max_undelivered_messages = 1000

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "influx"
