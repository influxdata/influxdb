description: Back-port the specified PR from the Enterprise repository.
---
Port changes from the `influxdb_pro` repository to this repository for the following pull request (PR): https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb_pro/pull/#$ARGUMENTS.

## Approach

1. Pull the latest changes on the `main` branch and start a new branch off of `main`
2. Create a patch file using the changes in the linked PR (see the "Patch rules" section below)
3. Apply the generated patch to the repository
4. Run all tests (`cargo nextest run --workspace --no-fail-fast`) and address any test failures that arise (you may need to use `cargo insta review` if any `insta` snapshots need to be updated)
5. Run `cargo clippy` to check lints, any fix any linter errors (you can use the `--fix` argument to `cargo clippy` to have it attempt to apply fixes manually)
6. Run `cargo fmt --all` to format the code
7. Commit your changes and open a PR to this repository (the commit message should be named `chore: backport <changes>` where changes are a short description of what is being back-ported from the `influxdb_pro` repository)
8. The PR should reference the original PR on the `influxdb_pro` repository that the changes were backported from

## Patch rules

1. The patch should not include any files with `enterprise` in the name or file path.
2. The patch should not include any files under the `influxdb3` directory
3. The patch should not include any files that end in `.snap`
4. The patch should not include changes to the `Cargo.lock` file
